                        <li>Cicadas can survive a huge fall as babies, or nymphs. They are about the size of a grain of rice when they drop from a tree branch to the ground and start digging.</li>
                        <li>Most have red-orange eyes. But occasionally cicadas have blue, white or grayish eyes.</li>
                        <li>They’re true bugs (from the order Hemiptera). So you can call them a bug and be scientifically accurate.</li>

                       <li>Pigeons can move their wings ten times per second and maintain heartbeats at the rate of 600 times per minute, during the period of 16 hours.</li>
                       <li>Pigeons have very sensitive sense of hearing. They are able to detect distant storms, earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.</li>
